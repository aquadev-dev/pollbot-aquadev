<h1 align="left">Discord Poll Bot</h1>
<p align="left">A JavaScript Discord bot that utilises MongoDB to create a poll system that allows members of the Discord server to vote on a topic of discussion with two options.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  While working on my Discord bot for the computer science Discord server, I found two unique features I created that I would like to showcase separately: a suggestion system bot and a poll bot. When working on the suggestion system, I realised that I could also turn it into a poll system, where the figures and bars update in real time as people vote for the options, just like the suggestion system but configured to display differently.

- Currently allows the users to vote between two options with buttons they can click to vote with
- Checks to see if someone has already voted, so you can’t vote twice
- Bars update in real-time through the use of a MongoDB database
- Admins can decide when it’s time to end a poll by pressing the ‘Results’ button
